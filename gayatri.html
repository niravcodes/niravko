			To write is to remember. But each remembrance, each reminiscence tints the beautiful past with colors of the
			present. And so, I'm ever-afraid to write about certain things.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are such things: things that exist so separate, so independent, from everything else that I don't dare
			write them down. Things such as walking next to you around Lakeside just as a twilight was cooking atop
			Phewa; and where a neon ferris wheel spun slicing the sky. Things such as watching you board the bus to your
			city, 9AM. Words had failed me then, and I’d forgotten the language of the throat. Instead I had hoped, and
			perhaps so had you, that we'd be able to decipher the language of longing that only our eyes speak.
		</p>
		<p>
			You’ve given me so many memories like this that, like a child carrying an armful of flowers I fear that I’ll
			unwittingly spill them; let some fall to the ground and walk on, unaware. I might drop a little daisy of
			that smile you only smile when I make a silly joke. Or a sunflower from that sunny morning when you sat on
			my lap and told me the stories of your life. I might walk on even as I’ve dropped a red chrysanthemum of all
			the candlelight conversations; or a white lily from the time you danced under the moonlight; the Lamachaur
			streets were empty and I walked, enchanted, carrying pastries with little cherries on top.
		</p>

		<p>
			I’m deeply terrified that I’ll forget any of these precious memories, yet also endlessly afraid that writing
			them down will reduce them to mere words. Vacuous words that never ever mean what I want to say.
		</p>
		<p>
			In times like these, I have to remind myself that, since <span class="italic">Gayatri is wholly and utterly
				mine</span>, we’ll continue
			to make yet more of such memories. So it's okay to let the relentless timeriver steal a little daisy here, a
			little marigold there. Hell, let it steal entire bouquets. After all, with the love that you give me, we can
			easily conjure gardens full of the most beautiful flowers at whim for the rest of reality.
		</p>
		<p class="love">I love you</p>
